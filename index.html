            <h1>Science Dots: A Writing Project by Jacob Shpiece</h1>
            <p>Hi! Welcome to my little corner of notekeeping and trivialities. As a graduate student in my sixth year of research, I spend most of my time reading and writing 
                extremely technical work - I enjoy the careful precision of academic language, but even I have to concede that it can dull the sense of wonder that got me 
                into science. Not to mention, after a few years of paper writing, there's a tendency for academics to write only in that passive, exacting tone. Worse, 
                to my mind, this kind of selection means that failure gets hidden. The work of a PhD student tends to be eleven months of failure, followed by two frenetic 
                weeks of success, at the end of which you present on the two weeks and make no mention of the eleven months. This is a place for the eleven months. 
                It's where I'll keep notes of works in progress, tidbits of code and design, and the occasional rant that I need to get off my chest. I hope you find 
                something interesting here!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Jacob Shpiece, a PhD student studying physics at Drexel University. I'm currently in my sixth year of research, and I'm working in the field of 
                gravitational lensing. My thesis work is focused on developing statistical tests for the detection of dark matter substructure in galaxy clusters, 
                without relying on the assumptions made by many traditional lensing methods - the hope being that this new method will be sensitive to clumps of dark 
                matter that don't have much light associated with them, and so that traditional methods would be left blind to. For more about my research, check out 
                my <a href="research-blog.html">'blog'</a>. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                It's crucial to have interests outside of research (first year grad students, take note). I've been involved in the parlor LARP gaming community for 
                about a decade now. I've run multi-year chronicles for clubs in Maryland and Philadelphia, have been a lead game runner and writer for games at the 
                PAX Unplugged convention since 2017, and am a cofounder and the Chief Facillitator of Spectacle Inc, and oops! I went and turned my 'interests outside 
                research' into a second job. I'll also probably put thoughts on game design and the projects I'm working on up here. When I need a break from all of 
                that - I read, play games (currently trying to learn Starcraft), or work on a side project (the most recent was a (very crude) Go bot that I hope to 
                improve down the road).
